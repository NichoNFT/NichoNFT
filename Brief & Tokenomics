The purpose of issuing $NICHO governance token is to enable our community to be the future driving force for building the marketplace. The ultimate goal of Nicho NFT is to develop into a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where all governance and decision-making rights belong to platform users. Need new functionality? Provide a better opinion for the platform? Some of the content is inappropriate and should be sanctioned? Or should certain members receive arts or community funding? In a DAO, your voice will be heard.
